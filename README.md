### About this repository
This is a forked repository based off the initial group work, which allows me to play around with my own edits. 

### About the code

This is a simple program based on the popular role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. The program takes in parameters for a player or monster, adds the player or monster's characteristics to a table of players and monsters, and dynamically generates attack values for any player or monster.

To generate a player, provide all characteristics, including a class. 
To generate a monster, provide all characteristics, except a class (select "None"). 
Click the button with the player or monster's name to generate a new attack value.
